# TDM-Test-Setup
Test setup for tendon-driven manipulators for master thesis at TU Delft.
It contains a custom designed tension sensor comprising a spring, Hall effect sensor and permanent magnet.
The setup is adaptable for up to 12 actuators and consist of a distal (cone shaped) and proximal (actuators and sensors) section.
A manipulator can be removably attached in the distal section.
Manipulators up to 20 mm in diameter can be actuated using this design.
Manipulators consisting of up to 3 individually actuated segments can be tested (2 DoF per segment).

The map "Solidworks model of prototype" contains the design files of the test setup.
The map "Running_Prototype_Arduino" contains the Arduino script to run the setup. This works together with the Matlab script "Prototype_Run_Code.m"
