# TDM-Test-Setup
Test setup for tendon-driven manipulators for master thesis at TU Delft.
It contains a custom designed force sensor comprising a spring, Hall effect sensor and permanent magnet.
The setup is adaptable for up to 12 actuators.
A manipulator can be removably attached in the distal section (with the cone shape).
The map "Solidworks model of prototype" contains the design files of the test setup.
The map "Running_Prototype_Arduino" contains the Arduino script to run the setup. This works together with the Matlab script "Prototype_Run_Code.m"
